gpx_to_aerial
=============

This script generates aerial images using the google map's API based off coordiantes in gpx files.


It was designed to need as minimal of user interaction as possible. Once the script is turned into an executable file, you drag and drop the gpx file onto it, and then it creates the .jpg files in its directory.
